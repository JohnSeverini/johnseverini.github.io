Before joining Georgetown, I worked for Columbia University's [Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies (SIWPS)](https://www.siwps.org/) as well as for the [Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)](https://www.csis.org/).

I graduated with a BA in Political Science and Linguistics from The Ohio State University and an MPA in International Security Policy from Columbia's School of International and Political Affairs (SIPA).

I currently reside in Washington, DC.
